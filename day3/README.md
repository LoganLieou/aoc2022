## Day 3

### Part 1

Find the common element between the first half and the second half of the
string for each string in the input value

How I did this: iterate across characters in first half, then search second
half.

### Part 2

Find the common item between 3 lines of "rucksacks"

Iterate across first line search other two strings for the character if found
return value.

## Why C++

Bc I'm lazy, and wanted to get my problems done, probably should go back an
solve with ocaml at somepoint not rn so lazy
