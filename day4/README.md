## Day 4

Yeah so using Java because I need to review for my class, anyways, FP so much
better for parsing, gg, this was really scuffed and bad need to be able to
compose and map so based idk this probably exists in Java but I tried to use
stuff we learn from class which means the worst possible imperitive
implementation possible.

## Part 1

We're looking for how many intervals contain each other

## Part 2 

We're looking for how many intervals are overlapping, I think this one is
probably easier, as it's a standard leetcode problem with intervals that
everyone solves when looking at intervals for coding interview.
